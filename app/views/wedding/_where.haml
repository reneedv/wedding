  %h1.where.copy The Sinister Timberline Lodge
  %p.where.copy Tim&shy;ber&shy;line Lodge was con&shy;struc&shy;ted by hand with an army of starving and des&shy;per&shy;ate WPA work&shy;ers dur&shy;ing the Great De&shy;pres&shy;sion. Its rus&shy;tic style and warm halls be&shy;lie the sin&shy;is&shy;ter his&shy;tory of this lodge. Many ghosts have been spot&shy;ted out&shy;side the first aid room, where count&shy;less un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate ski&shy;ers and moun&shy;tain&shy;eers have lost their lives over the long years. It is un&shy;known how many venge&shy;ful climb&shy;ing wights roam the up&shy;per moun&shy;tain, seek&shy;ing to de&shy;vour the breath and warmth of any who dare tres&shy;pass above the tree-line. Tim&shy;ber&shy;line Lodge stands on this threshold, astride the gulf between the liv&shy;ing and the dead.
   
  %p.where.copy The high&shy;way lead&shy;ing up the moun&shy;tain to&shy;wards the lodge was blas&shy;ted out of a ridge-line con&shy;tain&shy;ing an Nat&shy;ive Amer&shy;ic&shy;an Buri&shy;al Ground. To this day, su&shy;per&shy;sti&shy;tious loc&shy;als refer to the pass as the Si&shy;lent Rocks, and re&shy;fuse to speak while driv&shy;ing through that sec&shy;tion. Many un&shy;wary trav&shy;el&shy;ers have lost their lives on these twist&shy;ing moun&shy;tain roads, al&shy;though who is to say wheth&shy;er it was the ice <em>or something else</em> from bey&shy;ond the nat&shy;ur&shy;al world.
   
  %p.where.copy Tim&shy;ber&shy;line Lodge was fea&shy;tured in Kubrik&#8217;s clas&shy;sic Hor&shy;ror film The Shin&shy;ing. Do not fear though, can&shy;ni&shy;bal&shy;ist&shy;ic pi&shy;on&shy;eer spir&shy;its are thought by main&shy;stream his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;ans to be en&shy;tirely fic&shy;tion&shy;al.
